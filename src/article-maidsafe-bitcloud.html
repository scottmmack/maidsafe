                <p><em>This is a guest post by  <a href="http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/people/research-students/julia-powles/4273">Julia Powles</a>, who researches and writes on law, science and technology at the University of Cambridge. </em></p>
                <p>One of the great things about the architecture of the internet is that it is truly decentralized. By design, no one rules it and everyone can use it. But in the last two decades, a small collection of global technology companies have come to control the bulk of internet traffic. Google, Facebook, and others have captured our attention and with it, our data. In the face of such consolidation, concerns about the implications for personal privacy and security have never been more pressing. This is particularly the case following the <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/08/how-the-us-almost-killed-the-internet">NSA/GCHQ global surveillance revelations</a>. For many, the solution to this situation is to return the internet to its original state -- distributed, open, and decentralized.</p>
                <p>Last week's <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/27/bitcloud">announcement of Bitcloud</a>, a theoretical peer-to-peer network project that bypasses centralised servers and uses individual devices as secure nodes for routing and distributing network traffic captured significant media attention. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/12/the-mission-to-decentralize-the-internet.html">It is certainly not the first time that the idea of a peer-to-peer redesign of the whole internet has been vaunted</a>, and it holds great appeal to those who think end-to-end encryption is needed. But such a system, workable at scale, is still just a thought experiment. Or is it?</p>
