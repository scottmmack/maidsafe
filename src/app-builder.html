<p>By introducing the SAFE networks very own crypto currency, safecoin, developers now finally have an Open Source business model that works. By coding
your safe wallet ID into your application(s), the network will automatically pay safecoins to you based on how much the application is utilised by end
users. No longer will app developers need to morph themselves into support experts or advertising resellers, you can now focus on making great applications
with a revenue stream already built in.</p>

<p>As an Open Source developer access to the SAFE network will be completely free of charge, enabling you to outperform all incumbents, with back end infra 
structure that automatically adapts in real-time to demand fluctuations, which also allows you to offer anonymity, security and privacy to all your users.</p>
