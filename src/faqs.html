            <h1>FAQs</h1>
            <p>The following questions are ones we have been asked directly, or our staff have come across online. The list is not exhaustive, so if there is anything you want to know write to us at <a href="mailto:info@maidsafe.net">info@maidsafe.net </a></p>
            <h2 id="difference"><a href="#difference">What makes MaidSafe stand out from other projects that promise a decentralized Internet (BitCloud, Meshnet, Freenet, etc.)?</a></h2>
            <p>We differ from many of the organisations and products in our space as we have the decentralized Internet at the core of our design. Some of these projects are currently trying to add components that bend them into the shape of a decentralized Internet, but this is not what they were designed for. As a result, many of these projects require significant set up and only work on certain platforms. It is worth noting that MaidSafe supports any project that backs a decentralized Internet, however we don't see any with the same vision as MaidSafe: Privacy, Security and Freedom for everyone!</p>
            <h2 id="who-owns"><a href="#who-owns">Who owns the MaidSafe platform?</a></h2>
            <p>No one, it is a resource there for all users of the Internet. The MaidSafe network is completely anonymous, secure and aims to repel human intervention of any kind; it cannot be controlled or 'owned'. We feel very strongly about this and have written a <a href="http://blog.maidsafe.net/2014/02/07/owning-the-network/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the subject: </p>
            <h2 id="patents"><a href="#patents">A truly autonomous distributed network shouldn't need patents to protect it, right?</a></h2>
            <p>Our patents exist in a purely defensive capacity, to protect MaidSafe and the developers that use the platform. MaidSafe do not own the patents, they only have the rights to use them, royalty free and in perpetuity. The MaidSafe Foundation, a registered charity, actually own the patents.</p>
            <h2 id="old-technology"><a href="#old-technology">MaidSafe technology is nothing new; isn't this company just throwing up marketing hype around it then mentioning Bitcoin?</a></h2>
            <p>Our papers, patents and design documents describe crypto currencies being crucial to a distributed network (otherwise identity leaks are inevitable). They're all available online with early design specifications (such as Perpetual Coin) and were published in 2006, as were many of our initial patents.</p>
            <h2 id="why-the-name"><a href="#why-the-name">Why the name MaidSafe?</a></h2>
            <p>It's an acronym; "Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone".</p>
            <h2 id="how-to-start"><a href="#how-to-start">How can I start to use MaidSafe?</a></h2>
            <p>First, it will help to understand that MaidSafe is not a product, it's a platform. We provide the distributed infrastructure on which developers will build applications.  As developers start to create these apps, we will all have access to products that enable complete privacy and security in a data-centre-free environment.</p>
            <h2 id="research"><a href="#research">What kind of research and validation has been done to affirm that this system is robust and secure, at least in theory?</a></h2>
            <p>With such a radical solution, validation is extremely important. MaidSafe's technology has been peer reviewed with papers published and presented at the Wireless World Research Forum and the IEEE Computer Society. During development, MaidSafe has engaged with Scotland's leading technical Universities; Stirling, Strathclyde, St Andrews and the University of Abertay. Furthermore, MaidSafe's founder, David Irvine, has showcased the company's technology at the Google Scalability conference and at the British Computer Society's (Scotland) 50th Anniversary Christmas lecture.</p>
            <h2 id="connection"><a href="#connection">Does MaidSafe require continuous Internet connection from all participants?</a></h2>
            <p>No, the network will rate each connection type and adjust for the resources it provides, in order to account for unavailability (through powering off or device failure). It's not a problem to be disconnected for shorter periods, however.  If your node is unavailble for longer periods it will negatively impact on the service you receive from the network.</p>
            <h2 id="compromise-or-disruption"><a href="#compromise-or-disruption">Is there any way to compromise or disrupt MaidSafe, such as setting up a very large number of computers with poor upload speeds but huge hard drives?</a></h2>
            <p>The number of computers would have to massively outnumber the network nodes. When a node joins, its ID is altered by existing nodes and put at a random location. You would have to add a significant number of nodes and be extremely lucky in getting 4 close to each other in the address space. Even then the damage may be limited to a single chunk group.</p>
            <h2 id="data-redundancy"><a href="#data-redundancy">How does the network deal with data redundancy, to ensure whatever data is shared remains accessible?</a></h2>
            <p>Each file is encrypted and split into chunks during our encryption process (Self Encryption). The network keeps and maintains 4 copies of each encrypted chunk and moves these fragments around the network as nodes become unavailable, either through failure or power down. In order to cope with this churn, the network is able to reconfigure globally extremely quickly (possibly as fast as 20 milliseconds). These steps ensure data is always available, provided the user retrieving the data has an Internet connection and the correct credentials.</p>
